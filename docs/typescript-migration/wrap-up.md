# TypeScript Migration Wrap-up

This document captures the final housekeeping that followed the TypeScript conversion. It records the state of the quality gates, summarises clean-up tasks, and documents conventions that should guide future TypeScript development.

## Final Quality Gates

| Command | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pnpm check` | ✅ Passed | Biome reports no formatting or linting issues.
| `pnpm typecheck` | ✅ Passed | `tsc --noEmit` completes with zero errors across the codebase.
| `pnpm test` | ✅ Passed | Vitest suite runs with coverage enabled and no regressions.
| `pnpm exec playwright test` | ✅ Passed | UI smoke tests succeed using the Playwright configuration in the repository.
| `pnpm build` | ✅ Passed | Vite outputs production assets under `dist/` without warnings.

*(See the latest CI or local command logs for timestamps associated with these runs.)*

## Clean-up Checklist

- Confirmed that the codebase no longer requires `// @ts-ignore` or redundant JSDoc shims now that modules expose typed exports directly.
- Audited module exports to ensure they surface concrete types (for example, the `MarkerCategory` union in `src/types/index.d.ts`).
- Updated repository documentation so the README, contribution guidance, and migration tracker all reflect TypeScript-first development.

## TypeScript Conventions

The migration surfaced a handful of practices that keep the project maintainable:

1. **Type-first module boundaries** – every public export should have an explicit type signature. Prefer re-exporting shared types from `src/types/` when multiple modules need the same contract.
2. **Leaflet integration** – extend Leaflet via ambient declarations in `src/types/leaflet-extensions.d.ts` rather than `@ts-ignore` patches in implementation files.
3. **DOM access** – narrow DOM queries with user-defined type guards where necessary instead of asserting with `as HTMLElement`. Typed helper functions (for example, in `filter-pane.ts`) should return refined element types.
4. **Storage safety** – keep persistence logic (`collection-store.ts`, `preferences-store.ts`) strongly typed by modelling JSON payloads with discriminated unions and helper guards.
5. **URL parameters** – coordinate URL parsing and serialisation through `url-state.ts`, ensuring functions accept the `MapId` and `MarkerId` unions exported from `src/types/`.
6. **Testing strategy** – mirror production types in tests so refactors catch API changes. Prefer importing the same TypeScript definitions rather than duplicating structural types inside the test suite.

## Lessons Learned

- Investing in shared literal unions up-front (`MarkerCategory`, `MapId`) removed the need for runtime assertions later in the migration.
- Type annotations around Leaflet integrations pay off quickly—hover interactions and marker toggles became easier to reason about once the callback signatures were explicit.
- Running `pnpm typecheck` alongside `pnpm check`, `pnpm test`, and `pnpm exec playwright test` before each commit provided fast feedback and prevented regressions from slipping in between migration waves.
- Maintaining human-readable documentation during the migration made it easier to onboard helpers without repeating historical context in pull requests.

Future enhancements should continue to update this document so the agreed TypeScript practices stay current.
